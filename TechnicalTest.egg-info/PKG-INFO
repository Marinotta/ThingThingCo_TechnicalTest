#### _Marina Lacambra's Technical Test_

This package is aimed to
- Clean a twitter dataset using https://pypi.org/project/tweet-preprocessor/ or similar tools.
- Train a sentiment analysis model using Scikit-learn.

## Functions

- _tweet-cleaner_: takes a tweet and removes its hashtags and mentions using tweet-preprocessor
- _tweet_tokenizer_: takes a tweet as a string and returns a list of its tokens.
- _tweet_stopword_remover_: takes a tokenized tweet and returns a list of its tokens without stopwords.

- _tweet_dataset_cleaner_tocsv_: reads a csv with a column "tweet", and writes a new csv with all the previous functions applied to it.
- _tweet_dataset_cleaner_: reads a csv with a column "tweet", and returns it with all the previous functions applied to it.

### To train a sentiment classifier
- _tweet_dataset_cleaner_: reads a csv with a column "tweet" and a column "label", and returns the metrics from the training.
